      - title: Why do I need to attend Follow-up Sessions to learn this method?
        content: >
          The Creighton Model FertilityCare System is incredibly specific. It is
          tailor-made for each woman’s body and reproductive category. The
          Introductory Session gives an overview of the Creighton Model, reviews
          basic anatomy and physiology, goes through charting situations, and
          explains the effectiveness for achieving and avoiding pregnancy.
          However, in order to learn the system and use it well, individual
          guidance and instruction of a FertilityCare Practitioner is essential.
          The Follow-up schedule starts off with frequent appointments initially
          in order to provide the necessary support that each client needs, it
          then becomes more spread out once you have learned how to observe and
          chart successfully.
      - title: Is it easy to learn the Creighton Model System?
        content: "It is relatively easy. Learning \_the Creighton Model System is a skill, like any skill after a bit of practice, it does become easy!\_The follow-ups with a trained FertilityCare Practitioner provide the couple with the confidence needed to quickly learn the System. The Creighton Model is not designed to be learned from a relative, friend, book or the information from this website.\_\n"

          How is the Creighton model different from other methods of natural
          family planning?
        content: >
          All methods of natural family planning revolve around fertility
          awareness and tracking particular signs from a woman’s body. The
          Creighton Model System is a mucus-only method using standardized
          descriptions that help women identify their days of fertility and
          infertility. It is particularly helpful to women who are
          breastfeeding, dealing with irregular cycles, and having trouble
          conceiving. With NaProTechnology, the Creighton Model System empowers
          clients to be their own advocate regarding their reproductive health
          and have meaningful discussions with their doctors about any
          abnormalities that they may be experiencing.
      - title: Do I have to be Catholic or religious to use this System?
        content: >
          No, the founders did establish the system teaching principles within a
          moral context but the system is for any woman! It serves any woman no
          matter their background or religious affiliation. The beauty of the
          system is its scientific foundation, based on over 40 years of
          research on the human reproductive system.

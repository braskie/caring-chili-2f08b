  I am not going to sugarcoat it, charting postpartum is difficult! Even as a
  Practitioner myself, I needed another set of eyes on my chart just to make
  sure. When youâ€™re not back into cycles and hormones are going crazy plus a
  lack of sleep, it makes charting very challenging. (This is why I always
  recommend seeing your Practitioner again during the postpartum phase!)

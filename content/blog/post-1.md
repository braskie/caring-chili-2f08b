Countless injections, ultrasounds, and pills, 7 IUI’s, 3 HSG’s, a sonohysterogram, and 3 surgeries all make for 4.5 years of infertility with little answers until we found NaPro, the Creighton Model and Kristin.

Our journey started the day we got married in May of 2015. We always talked about having a family, a BIG family. I wanted to be done having kids by the time I was 30; I wanted to be that young mom when my kids graduated from high school.

At first we thought, no pressure, this is going to happen, we will just let it happen when it happens.  A couple months went by, I thought I was pregnant as I was a week and a half late. I went to the store got all my supplies to make my husband a surprise to tell him we’re pregnant (it’s still hiding for that positive someday)and pregnancy tests! Pregnancy tests said “not pregnant,” but false negatives happen all the time and I was super late compared to normal. Two hours later, my period came. Okay, well then next month is our month.

![](/images/brooke-cagle-Y3L_ZQaw9Wo-unsplash.jpg)After 6 months, nothing. I started going through all the wrong things I did in my life. I had a major anxiety attack that lasted for 3 months! Blaming myself for not getting pregnant. I thought I was being punished by God. But was I? I started seeing an OB/GYN who said it’s only been 6 months, sometimes it takes time, nothing to worry about yet, as my pap was normal and I was a healthy young 24 year old.

March the following year (10 months into our journey) I went to see a new OB/GYN who agreed with me it was time to start the testing process as we were just shy of a year of trying to get pregnant. The next week I had an ultrasound. That was normal. Later that month, I had a HSG, or hysterosalpingogram. I heard mixed things about this, it hurts, it doesn’t hurt, it’s the worst ever, etc. The HSG itself was pretty easy, one simple cramping period that lasted 10 seconds. All was normal per the radiologist, no blockages! No big deal, that wasn’t so bad. Right?!

The next day I woke up with what felt like the worst flu of my life! After calling the doctor we figured it was just the flu, coincidence that I just had this test done and to rest, push fluids, etc. Two days later, I was getting worse. And to make it worse now my woman parts HURT! Fever consistently at 103, couldn’t even keep water down, it was time to go to urgent care, which turned into the ED. They decided they needed to do a vaginal exam. Speculum’s will always scare me forever now. They tried to put the speculum in and I screamed so loud I bet you the truck drivers on the interstate could hear me!! Eventually they got what they needed and found out I now had four different types of vaginal infections. Treatment started for that, but a couple days went by and I was still no better. I called my OB/GYN again and we were told to meet the on call doctor at the hospital. Being so sick, it took 3 people to get my IV in and to draw cultures from the opposite arm. Push come to shove, and we found out I had CMV. Then I got treated for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (NO woman wants to hear that diagnosis), as a precautionary measure due to the CMV and vaginal infections. Symptoms were treated and a week later I was finally able to return to almost my normal daily life. Now it is our time to get pregnant, right?![](/images/brooke-cagle-oMtXGNw4ZEs-unsplash.jpg)

The OB/GYN decided to put me on letrozole to try and help us get pregnant, 6 weeks after the CMV diagnosis. Still nothing. One of my friends went to a fertility clinic close to our home so I self referred and next thing I knew we were there.

First thing we found out, was their was no way we should be even attempting to get pregnant right now because CMV can cause major birth defects. Thank GOD we didn’t get pregnant then!! We had to wait almost 6 months, from the diagnosis, before we were finally allowed to start trying to get pregnant. During that time, my husband had his semen analysis done, which was normal! They drew a bunch of labs, put me through more ultrasounds, and decided letrozole was the best place to restart trying. We opted for 3 months of letrezole and intercourse, as infertility treatments are INSANELY EXPENSIVE!

> Until someone goes through infertility they never truly understand. It’s not just a cold, or a broken bone. Month after month we’re mourning something that isn’t true, someone who isn’t there.
